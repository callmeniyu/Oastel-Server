# Stripe Webhook Implementation - Solution Documentation

## Problem Solved

Fixed the issue where Stripe payments were showing as "incomplete, cancelled and failed" in the admin panel. This was happening because webhook events from Stripe weren't properly updating the booking status when payments succeeded.

## Solution Overview

Implemented a comprehensive Stripe webhook system that:

1. **Receives webhook events** from Stripe when payments are processed
2. **Verifies webhook signatures** for security
3. **Updates booking status** from "pending" to "confirmed" when payments succeed
4. **Sends confirmation emails** using the existing Brevo email service
5. **Prevents duplicate processing** with event deduplication

## Key Components

### 1. Stripe Webhook Controller (`stripeWebhook.controller.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Handle incoming webhook events from Stripe
- **Security**: Verifies webhook signatures to ensure events are authentic
- **Events Handled**:
  - `checkout.session.completed` - Checkout flow completed
  - `payment_intent.succeeded` - Payment successful
  - `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Payment failed
- **Deduplication**: Prevents processing the same event multiple times

### 2. Booking Service Enhancements (`booking.service.ts`)

- **handleStripeSuccess()**: Updates booking status to "confirmed" and sends email
- **handleStripeFailure()**: Updates booking status to "cancelled" for failed payments
- **Email Integration**: Uses existing Brevo email service for confirmations
- **Idempotent Updates**: Safe to call multiple times without side effects

### 3. Webhook Routes (`webhook.routes.ts`)

- **Endpoint**: `POST /webhook/stripe`
- **Middleware**: `express.raw()` to preserve request body for signature verification
- **Mounting**: Added to app.ts before `express.json()` middleware

### 4. Webhook Event Model (`WebhookEvent.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Track processed events to prevent duplicates
- **Schema**: Simple model with unique `eventId` constraint

## Email Confirmation Flow

When a payment succeeds via webhook:

1. Booking status updated to "confirmed"
2. Email data prepared from booking details
3. Existing Brevo email service called with confirmation template
4. Both customer confirmation and admin notification sent
5. Errors logged but don't fail the payment processing

## Testing

### Manual Testing with Test Script

```bash
# Start the server
cd server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the test script
node test-webhook.js
```

### Stripe CLI Testing (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI and login
stripe login

# Forward events to local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/webhook/stripe

# Trigger test events
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed
```

### Production Testing

1. Create a test booking in the application
2. Complete payment with a test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
3. Check that booking status changes to "confirmed"
4. Verify confirmation email is received
5. Check admin panel shows booking as confirmed

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables

```env
# Stripe webhook secret (get from Stripe Dashboard)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Brevo API key (already configured)
BREVO_API_KEY=xkeysib-...

# Database connection (already configured)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://...
```

### Stripe Dashboard Setup

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/webhook/stripe`
3. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy webhook secret to environment variables

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- `src/controllers/stripeWebhook.controller.ts` - Webhook event handler
- `src/routes/webhook.routes.ts` - Webhook routing
- `src/models/WebhookEvent.ts` - Event deduplication model
- `test-webhook.js` - Testing script

### Modified Files

- `src/services/booking.service.ts` - Added webhook handlers and email integration
- `src/app.ts` - Mounted webhook routes
- `src/controllers/payment.controller.ts` - Added bookingId to Stripe metadata

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Reliability**: Webhook-based updates are more reliable than redirect-based
2. **Real-time**: Status updates happen immediately when Stripe processes payment
3. **Security**: Signature verification ensures only Stripe can trigger updates
4. **Email Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Brevo email service
5. **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate processing of webhook events
6. **Idempotent**: Safe to retry operations without side effects

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Server Logs

Watch for these log messages:

- `‚úÖ Booking {id} marked confirmed via Stripe event`
- `üìß Confirmation email sent to {email} for booking {id}`
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate webhook event ignored: {eventId}`

### Admin Panel

- Check booking status shows "confirmed" instead of "pending"
- Verify payment status shows "succeeded"
- Monitor booking counts are accurate

### Stripe Dashboard

- Monitor webhook delivery attempts and success rates
- Check event logs for any failed deliveries
- Review payment intent status changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook signature verification fails**

   - Check `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is correct
   - Ensure `express.raw()` middleware preserves request body

2. **Emails not sending**

   - Verify `BREVO_API_KEY` is configured
   - Check email service logs for errors
   - Confirm booking has valid customer email

3. **Bookings not updating**
   - Check webhook events are being received
   - Verify booking exists with correct metadata
   - Review server logs for error messages

## Next Steps

1. Deploy webhook endpoint to production
2. Configure Stripe dashboard with production webhook URL
3. Test with real payments using Stripe test mode
4. Monitor webhook delivery and booking status updates
5. Set up alerts for webhook failures

This implementation resolves the "incomplete, cancelled and failed" booking status issue by ensuring Stripe payment events properly update booking records in real-time.
